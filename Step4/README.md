# Step 4: Adding a real robot into the world

## Download the `Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description` Package

**If you are using eceprog**, the `Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description` package has already been installed, and you do not need to download it. Instead, just visit the [package on github](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description) and look around the files there.

**If you are not using eceprog**, clone the `Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description` into your ws2/src folder and build it. This depends on which version of ROS you are using. (If you forgot, just run `ls /opt/ros/` and see if humble or jazzy is in that folder.) If you are using ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04, run the following commands to install the package:
```bash
rosds
git clone https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description.git
git checkout origin/humble 
cb
```
If you are using ROS2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04, run the following command to install the package:
```bash
rosds
git clone https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description.git
git checkout origin/jazzy
cb
```

**For all students**, verify that you can see the robot arm in RViz and manipulate the joints.

```bash
ros2 launch ur_description view_ur.launch.py ur_type:=ur3e
```

Browse through the `Universal_Robots_ROS2_Description/urdf/ur.urdf.xacro` file to see how the ur_macro.xacro is used. We will copy and paste a lot of this code in order to put the ur3e onto our table!

---

## Task 1: Create ur3e_on_table package

```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python ur3e_on_table
```

Add in the `view_ur3e_on_table.launch.py` and corresponding `ur3e_on_table.urdf.xacro` file to appropriate locations in your package, just like you did in Step 2. Build the package, then run the launch script. Take a screenshot of the robot on top of the table, with random joint positions.

---

## Publishing to the Joint State Topic
Until now, we have used the `joint_state_publisher_gui` node to publish the joint data for our robot. Now, we will learn to create our own ROS node which publishes our own joint data.

Run the command
```bash
ros2 launch ur3e_on_table view_ur3e_on_table.launch.py
```
and then run
```bash
ros2 topic list -t
```
Observe that `/joint_states` is of type `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState`. Now run
```ros
ros2 topic echo --once /joint_states
```
to understand what type of message we will need to send. You should see something like this:
```yaml
header:
  stamp:
    sec: 1720633538
    nanosec: 252970928
  frame_id: ''
name:
- shoulder_pan_joint
- shoulder_lift_joint
- elbow_joint
- wrist_1_joint
- wrist_2_joint
- wrist_3_joint
position:
- 0.0
- 0.0
- 0.0
- 0.0
- 0.0
- 0.0
velocity: []
effort: []
---
```

Now let's add some ros2 nodes filled with Python code to publish `sensor_msgs/msg/JointState` messages to the `/joint_states` topic to move the robot. Move the `joint_publisher_test.py` and `joint_publisher_lissajous.py` files inside your `ws2/src/ur3e_on_table/ur3e_on_table` folder (just like Lab 1, Step 3). Your `package.xml` file should contain the following dependencies (simply the import statements in our python files):
```xml
    <exec_depend>rclpy</exec_depend>
    <exec_depend>sensor_msgs</exec_depend>
    <exec_depend>numpy</exec_depend>
```
Also copy and paste the `lissajous.csv` file into the `resource` folder. Next, modify your `setup.py` file as follows:
```python
import os
from glob import glob
from setuptools import find_packages, setup

package_name = 'ur3e_on_table'
# ...

    data_files=[
        # ...
        (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*')),
        (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'rviz'), glob('rviz/*')),
        (os.path.join('share', package_name, 'urdf'), glob('urdf/*')),
    ],
    # ...
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'test = ur3e_on_table.joint_publisher_test:main',
            'lissajous = ur3e_on_table.joint_publisher_lissajous:main',
        ],
    },
```
Build your ros2 packages with `cb`. In a terminal run the test code executable:
```bash
ros2 run ur3e_on_table test
```
This example uses time to calculate the robot joint position:
```python
msg.position = [2*np.pi*t/5, -1+0.5*np.cos(2*np.pi*t/10), np.sin(2*np.pi*t/15), 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
```
You should see lots of position data being printed to the terminal. In another terminal, do a `ros2 node list` and a `ros2 topic list -t` to do a sanity check and confirm your `joint_publisher_test` node is publisher to `/joint_states`. Do the same thing for the `lissajous` executable to confirm it can read data from the csv file correctly.

## Task 2: Tracing the Test Curve

Write a launch file called `test_ur3e_on_table.launch.py` which visualizes the ur3e robot on a table, and uses the `test` executable from the `ur3e_on_table` package to publish the joint states. This script should be very similar to `view_ur3e_on_table.launch.py`, but you will need to modify the `joint_state_publisher_node` within the launch script so that the `test` executable runs.

Run your launch script. RViz should open, and the robot should be moving. In RViz select `RobotModel > Links > tool0 > Show Trail`.

Take a screenshot of your RViz window, with at least part of the blue curve visible.

## Task 3: Tracing the Lissajous Curve

Create another launch script called `lissajous_ur3e_on_table.launch.py` which shows the ur3e arm on the table, and publishes data from the lissajous executable.

Enable the trail for `tool0`. You should see a blue lissajous curve (figure of 8) appear. Take a screenshot of your Rviz window for the lab report.

## Task 4: Linear Interpolation through Joint Space

Congrats on getting this far in Lab 2! Since the start of the semester, you have learned a lot about ROS nodes/topics, URDF/XACRO files, and ROS packages. Now let's combine these all together, with some basic motion planning!

Your task is to create a new executable called `pick-and-place` within the `ur3e_on_table` package which can move between two positions in space. We will define two joint position vectors $p_1$ and $p_2$, which represent the beginning and end of the trajectory. These vectors live in $\mathbb{R}^6$ because the robot arm has 6 joints. We can interpolate between the two joint positions linearly with a parameter $0 \le a \le 1$ as follows:

$$
p = (1 - a) p_1 + a p_2
$$

where $p$ represents the current joint position. Note that when $a=0$, $p=p_1$; when $a=1$, $p=p_2$. 

We want to start at $p_1$, wait 5 seconds, move to $p_2$, wait 5 seconds, and then move back to $p_1$, before repeating the process. Here is some starter code which implements this behavior:

```python
# other imports...
import numpy as np

def linear_interpolate(p1, p2, a):
    return (1-a)*p1 + a*p2

class JointPublisherPickAndPlace(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        # other ros code ...

        # define your start/end points
        self.p1 = np.array([0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0])
        self.p2 = np.array([-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0])

    def timer_callback(self):

        # 0..5 seconds: stay at p1
        # 5..10 seconds: move towards p2
        # 10..15 seconds: stay at p2
        # 15..20 seconds:: move towards p1
        if self.t < 5:
            a = 0
        elif self.t < 10:
            a = (self.t - 5)/5
        elif self.t < 15:
            a = 1
        elif self.t < 20:
            a = 1 - (self.t - 15)/5
        
        p = linear_interpolate(self.p1, self.p2, a).tolist()

        # other code ...
        msg.position = p
        # other code ...

        # reset self.t after 20 seconds are up
        self.t += self.timer_period
        if self.t >= 20:
            self.t = 0
        
```

Create a new ROS node `JointPublisherPickAndPlace` and a corresponding executable called `pick-and-place`, which publishes joint positions to smoothly move between joint positions $p_1$ and $p_2$. Write a corresponding launch script which visualizes the robot arm doing this pick and place motion. Visualize the robot moving in RViz with the trail enabled for the `tool0` link. Take a screenshot for your lab report.
